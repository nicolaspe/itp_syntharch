# Room Assignment

## Instructions
1. You will then be tasked with designing and building an environment based on your interpretation of the chosen room description. Although the descriptions are specific there is a large amount of space left for creative interpretation. Despite this freedom you must consider that a human will need to exist within this space. It doesnâ€™t mean that the space needs to be designed for humans or that there will be a human avatar, but rather that a human will need to interact with the space in the most fundamental way (ie. using their eyes, ears and hands). By the next class you will be expected to have the following:
	- All of the elements and props you will need to build your environment.
	- Rough sketches of the environment indicating the layout of walls, the placement of objects and the use of lighting. These can be in the form of hand drawn sketches or using digital tools such as Illustrator, Photoshop and Tilt Brush.
	- References of environments that express the feeling and mood you are interested in achieving. These can be in the form of screenshots, photographs or collages. The focus is less on the specifics and more on the overall feeling conveyed by an assembly of space, texture and light.
	- Also think about the role of sound in the space. Do any of the objects produce sound? Maybe the room has a subtle tone or there is literally music playing out of a speaker in the room?
